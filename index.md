# Welcome to Ahsan Farooqui's github page. 

[Python Tutorials] (https://github.com/ahsanfarooqui/Python-Programming-Exercise/)
These tutorials are made for a quicker review of Python Programming language. Follow the notebook and get equipped with the basic Python Exercises. 

## Deep Learning
### [Backpropagation Example] (https://github.com/ahsanfarooqui/backprop-example)
A simple pen-and-paper example of backpropagation iteration. Good for someone who is new with deep learning and wants to code their first custom code for backpropagation. 

### [Convolutional Autoencoders] (https://github.com/ahsanfarooqui/convolutional-autoencoders)
Explored autoencoders and regenerated images from encoded parameters

### [GANs] (https://github.com/ahsanfarooqui/gans-mnist)
Explored vanilla GANs on MNIST dataset 

## Machine Learning
### [Binary Classification] (https://github.com/ahsanfarooqui/binary-classification-ml)
Explored various dimensionality reduction, feature extraction and binary classification methods on images data. 

### [Kmeans Clustering] (https://github.com/ahsanfarooqui/kmeans-clustering)
Explored kmeans clustering and how to evaluate unsupervised learning

## Natural Language Processing
Majority of work done is for Urdu Language. I also contributed to [Mozilla Common Voice] (https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/) Project with urdu dataset.
### [Urdu Poetry Generation using ngrams] (https://github.com/ahsanfarooqui/urdu-poetry-ngrams)
### [Fake News detection using Naive Bayes Theorem] (https://github.com/ahsanfarooqui/urdu-fake-news-naive-bayes)
### [Roman Urdu Spelling Checker] (https://github.com/ahsanfarooqui/roman-urdu-spelling-correction)
### [Urdu Sentence Segmentation] (https://github.com/ahsanfarooqui/urdu-sentence-segmentation)
### [Urdu Question Answering (UQuAD) dataset] (https://github.com/ahsanfarooqui/UQuAD---Urdu-Question-Answer-Dataset)
